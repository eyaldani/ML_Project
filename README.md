# Machine Learning Project
## This project was made as part of MACHINE LEARNING course at Tel Aviv University

The goal of the project was to create a binary classification model 


### The code includes several parts:

1 - Data Exploration

2 - Pre-Processing: handling missing values, removing outliers, creation of new features, data normalization, dimension reduction (PCA) 

3 - Model Training and Estimation: examining several ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, KNN, ANN, RF, and XGBoost

4 - Selecting the optimal algorithm based on AUC
